This repository includes the shared files used on my various versions of my personal website hosted on GH pages, pythonanywhere, and linode: [üë©‚ÄçüöÄAstroVueStaticSite](https://github.com/MarmadileManteater/AstroVueStaticSite), [‚ö°QwikStaticSite](https://github.com/MarmadileManteater/QwikStaticSite), [SvelteKitSite](https://github.com/MarmadileManteater/SvelteKitSite).

I have not made any alterations to either of them. This repository simply acts as a way to pull all of these images in as a git submodule.

Both of these emoji are included in this repository because I wanted my websites to support all emoji in the Unicode 14.0 spec, and while Mutant Standard provides a [‚ô•lovely collection of custom emoji](https://mutant-cheat-sheet.netlify.app/), my goal was to use these like a font. I wanted something that I could just throw on top of my existing code, and at the end of the day, I could always remove, and just go back to serving plain jane üë©emoji.
