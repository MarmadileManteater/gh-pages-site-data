I guess you could say this is the <span style='white-space: nowrap;'>🌘beginning</span> of a new one. What can I say? I had multiple versions of the same website, and now, I only have just one, and you barge in here, into my blog, demanding that I explain myself? Well, you have some guts.</p>

    <p class='text-xl pb-4'>I have discovered that I am quite a fan of the <a href='https://svelte.dev/' class='hover:underline text-blue-600 dark:text-red-300' >Svelte</a> way of doing things. In a lot of ways, it feels kind of like a natural extension of the 🍦vanilla web platform, and that is very much <a href='https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/web-standards' class='hover:underline text-blue-600 dark:text-red-300'>by <span style='white-space: nowrap;'>📐design</span></a>.</p>

    <p class='text-xl pb-4'>This component syntax does everything that I want it to do without me having to put a whole lot of <span style='white-space: nowrap;'>🧠thought</span> into it, and I just can't really say that for <span style='white-space: nowrap;'>⚛React-like</span> JSX syntax or even Vue syntax. It just feels like what web development should be, out of the <span style='white-space: nowrap;'>📦box</span>, and what can I say? I just think it's <span style='white-space: nowrap;'>✨neat</span>.</p>

    <p class='text-2xl pb-4'>Of course, that's only one piece of this <span style='white-space: nowrap;'>🧩puzzle</span>!</p>
    
    <p class='text-xl pb-4'>So far, I've only been talking about Svelte, the frontend framework, but what about Sveltekit? Even though I could technically be using <span style='white-space: nowrap;'>👩‍🚀Astro</span> to do the same thing <em>(because I don't client side render)</em>, I personally prefer Sveltekit for the time being because I like it more than Astro's syntax which isn't JSX, but it is still <em>JSX-like</em> enough that I don't like it. My opinion on this could easily change, but it all comes down to whether or not I even want any <span style='white-space: nowrap;'>🥤hydration</span> at all in the future.</p>

    <p class='text-xl pb-4'>There we go. I said it. Finally, I got to the point I was trying to make this whole time.</p>
    <p class='text-xl pb-4'><strong>Why are you trying to reinvent browser navigation? Browsers already figured out how to do page navigation with good UX! They tell the user if the page is still loading. They might even give the user a little progress bar to let them know it is not just spinning forever.</strong></p>
    <p class='text-xl pb-4'>That's it. That's all I had to say. I might go back to Astro with Svelte eventually to try out <a href='https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/view-transitions/'  class='hover:underline text-blue-600 dark:text-red-300'>View Transitions</a> which are based on the experimental <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API' class='hover:underline text-blue-600 dark:text-red-300'>View Transitions API</a>. At the very least, it keeps the browser in charge of handling page navigation.</p>
